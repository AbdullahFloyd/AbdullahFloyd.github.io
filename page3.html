<h3>User research: summary</h3>
<p class="ptag">To start I came up with a hypothetical location for my user persona, Toronto Canada. I then considered, who would be the two most likely people who would want to attend a live venue

<ul class="list1">
  <li>someone who wants to document it</li>
    <li>And a casual attendee.</li>
</ul>
</p>What is there motives for using this app, and what do they hope to have completed by the end of the user journey?</p>

<h3>User research: pain points</h3>

<div class="container2">
        <div class="box">
            <h2>Ads</h2>
            <p>Finding a fast yet intuitive way to book a ticket is also quite a common issue.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>Scammers</h2>
            <p>Being unable to know where you will be sitting is also a pain point that many concert goers can relate to.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>Complicated</h2>
            <p>Price comparison of different seating layouts where not usually available.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>No Price Compare</h2>
            <p>Ads, scammers, and getting bombarded with ads that disrupt the ordering process is hard.</p>

<h3>Paper wireframes
</h3>
<p class="ptag">Using pen and paper I sketched down some ideas of what i thought would work well for the main pages. I drew many! Wireframes on multiple sheets, and condensed all the things I loved and tried to make one I would iterate on.
