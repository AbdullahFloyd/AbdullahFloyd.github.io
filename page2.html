    <h4>Case study</h4>


<p class="description"> "The Islamic Supplication app is a
Personalized app for finding supplications
That fit your current circumstance."
</p>
</div>
<p class="ptag">After I learned more about the purpose of this project, I realized I wanted to create an app that departed from the typical 'modern' aesthetic of rounded rectangles. Instead, I envisioned a more organic design approach. The goal is for the app to be intuitive and easy to understand for everyone, regardless of race or religion. To enhance accessibility, the app would allow users to download the text content and provide auditory buttons for navigation. <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/ZvzOBJfXxVVKt3JtjvLmjo/Supplication-app?node-id=20-99&t=tMo1SHOdUscf4PKf-1&scaling=scale-down&page-id=20%3A97&starting-point-node-id=20%3A99">GO SEE IT!!!.</a></p>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p class="ptag">This app was conceived from the necessity for an application tailored to the more intimate aspects of users' lives, particularly those who live alone. Often pursuing busy lives, they found it challenging to channel their emotions and feelings into something productive.<br> Until they stumbled upon this app, that is, <p class="ptag"><br> which taps into the need for understanding and, more importantly, hope. For a Muslim, having a connection to their faith wherever they are,<br> accessible with just a click on an app, is a valuable resource that can open new doors for introspection and improvement.</p></p>

<h3>RESEARCH ABOUT OUR COMPETITORS</h3>
<p class="ptag">I put together a basic competitive audit to figure out our main competitors for this app. The main competitors where two, one being a direct, and the other indirect for my target audience.

<h3>DESIGN PT1: paper Wireframes</h3>
<p class="ptag">I Used multiple sheets of paper to come up with many ideas, some were to sparse, and others were not visually appealing, finding a balance between looks, and function was the largest challenge. <br>

I also partook in crazy eights to force myself to come up with new designs, I also designed customized arrows.

<h3 class="bility">Reflections: Accessibility</h3>

<p class="ptag"><b>1.</b> I insured color schemes aligned with WebAIM  accessibility standards

</p>
<p class="ptag"><b>2.</b> Because of the website purpose I was sure to add the supplication in arabic, english, as well as transliteration

</p>
<p class="ptag"><b>3.</b> The app’s components used Gestalt principles to insure understanding.

</p>
<p class="ptag"><b>3.</b> All Icons were custom made to fit seamlessly with the apps oval/round aesthetic

</p>

<div class="circle"></div>


<h3 class="takeawa">Reflections: Takeaways </h3>
<p  class="ptag">I spent like two days just on the colors, but it’s important to know when to stop tweaking things and trust the test users opinions.</p>
<p class="ptag">I've seen that focusing on a target user is important but don’t focus only on the target user but anyone else who may use the product.</p>
<p class="ptag">Don’t fall in love with the initial bright idea you had and be open to completely changing an idea you had.</p>
<p class="ptag">Add images and textures along side blur’s drop shadows, and color’s to add even more texture and feeling to your designs</p>
